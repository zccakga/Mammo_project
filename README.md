# Mammo_project
This project aims to explore different machine learning techniques to analyse the "mammographic masses" public dataset from the UCI repository (source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mammographic+Mass) to create a model that predicts whether a tumour is benign or malignant.

80% accuracy was achieved 

This was part of an assignment encountered while doing a ML course on udemy.
